                    <p class="text-faded"> Treedom collaborates with small farmers all over the world to help them integrate a more sustainable agricultural system - Agroforestry.
                  <br>They also guarantee the wages of the farmers for the period while the trees planted are not yet productive, providing <b>food security</b> for the farmers and their communities boosting their <b>economical development</b>. </p>

                  <h3 class="section-heading"> What is Agroforestry?</h3>
                  <p class="text-faded"> Agroforestry is a <b>Sustainable Agricultural Practice</b> consisting in planting native aclimated species integrated in the local ecosystem.</p>

                  <p class="text-faded"> Every month we exchange the profit generated by the pool for trees at Treedom.
                      Every tree awill be identified with an unique ID which will allow our delegators to track them at any time.</p>

                  <h3 class="section-heading"><b>Why Treedom?</h3>
                  <p class="text-faded">We chose this project because of their <b>global impact</b> -  not only <b>ecological</b> - but within the <b>communities</b> being supported around the world.
                      <br>Also due to its <b>traceability </b>, that allow us to have maximum transparency with our delegators.</p>
                      <br>
                  <p class="text-faded">Each tree will then be planted and will be <b>traceable</b> - thanks to their <b>ID</b> system that allows you to have information on:
                  <ul class="text-faded">
                        <li><b>Where</b> the tree has been planted</li>
                        <li><b>Who</b> is the farmer that is caring for the tree</li>
                        <li><b>How</b>  is it doing - with an up-to-date <b>photo tag</b>.</li>
                 </ul>
                 </p>
